            for others this is the beginning of a whole new problem, finding developers and saving costs for your new startup.

        <h2 class="h2">Complete guidelines on how to setup your landing pages</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            Landing pages will assist you directing each user on your page, 
            taking into account what the user is expected to do,
            what is really expected from the user upon each sign up on your page,
            each user is different, keeping your affiliate page easy to understand is vital.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3">1. Layout</h3>
        <p class="lead">
            Every landing page should have a consistent layout, a form and some catchy image or video,
            the video is the introduction of the product or service offering,
            keep the form short i.e collecting email, first and lastname can take sometime,
            we recommend collecting just an email address which is useful for contacting the client later, 
            this helps with re-targeting for marketing campaigns.

        </p>

        <h3 class="h3">2. User support</h3>
        <p class="lead">Consider every user that visit your website,
            making the website complicated frustrates the end-users
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            <ul class="lead">
                <li>Create a simple form that every end-user will understand</li>
                <li>Avoid complex animation on the forms, this just adds complexity</li>
                <li>Use proper captures to check form SPAM, avoid complicated reCaptures with images</li>
                <li>Not every is able to see, add support for assistive technology</li>
                <li>Ensure the forms are mobile friendly</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3">3. Responsiveness</h3>
        <p class="lead">
            Making websites mobile friendly is a very important aspect,
            keep watch of font sizes, ensure the same message is communicated for all your website users,
            ensure the website page responds fast for smartphones,
            website speed improvements prevents users from leaving your website,
            keep the content updated, all landing page content should be relevant to boost SEO.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            Every page should be tested well, developers don't tend to have interest on business matters,
            why it matters to track the development cycle as a business owner,
            the critical mission is to get your sales funnel right,
            ensure that the flow covers all the steps required to close or get prospects,
            make it clear to the designers to highlight your brand,
            it should answer questions the user has in mind,
            clear requirements are to be addressed by the website,
            it doesn't help your business model to trick customers to sign up for newsletters,
            solve a problem that a customer has, don't just promise actually solve the problem,
            nothing frustrates than a service that guarantees 90% results but delivers 5% of work,
            build trust online with your customers, build a brand that lasts in their minds,
            keep them coming back to you for more information by staying relevant.
        </p>
         
         <h3 class="h3">4. Stick to the basics</h3>
         <p class="lead">
             You do not need to use complicated website technologies for a landing page,
             what you need is to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Your website designer should create a page that matches your current product,
             use your branding images, banners including video on your page,
             use JavaScript for functionality this doesn't mean download another entire JavaScript framework, 
             doing this will only slow down your page, opt for libraries instead there is no reason to add a library of functionality your page doesn't need,
             you could do more harm than good, no one likes a slow loading page, you want to support even the oldest devices,
             by that we mean smartphones should come first, stick to a simple mobile first approach nobody likes to be forced to sit to a PC,
             costs should be priority, laptops are expensive and mobile phones are first devices of choice for searching resources online,
             Google and other search engines come with rich features ready to use on mobiles, voice search and more.
         </p>

         <h3 class="h4">5. Capturing records to a database</h3>
         <p class="lead">
             We recommend NoSQL database, they are flexible enough with less complexity,
             all you have to do is save the data model in JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) to the database service provider,
             we use <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">firebase firestore</a> to support our website.
             firebase allows you to start with a free solution, you can use their authentication API to capture users, allow users to sign in with their verified Gmail account,
             Gmail is already verified this helps speed up the development process, capture the users and store records using either <b>firebase realtime</b> or <b>firebase firestore</b>
             both solve the same problem, while <b>firebase firestore</b> supports complex queries on data lookup, it is best to start with realtime database for it is more flexible.
