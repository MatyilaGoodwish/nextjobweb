                    Creating content for your affiliate network,
                    finding ways to adjust how your content looks takes time,
                    creating the right layout to send the right message is complicated,
                    there is not quick fix to good content strategy,
                    many sites promise to improve rankings by employing black hat tricks,
                    learning to create content the right way has a steap learning curve,
                    digital marketing just doesn't work well with content that has no structure,
                    every company should avoid inconsistencies when publishing a website,
                    the wrong content will cost your promotion money that should be your profits.

                <h3 class="h3">Failure at launch</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                    It just doesn't work well because nobody reads it,
                    good content makes sense to the right audience,
                    you don't have to pay somebody for your website content,
                    things that make websites fail, to address the main issues,
                    they are the same problems that drain company revenue overtime,
                    there is no need to rush deploying your website,
                    if everybody is waiting patiently for your business to go online,
                    building marketing concepts before the launch date usually assists,
                    ramp up competitions, surveys prior to launching your website,
                    when it all fails on the first day,
                    not measuring your website traffic is a bad practise,
                    neglecting your website after the launch is even worse,
                    having to put up a website for your business takes continuous effort,
                    if is lack of continuous effort to care for it, that breaks it.

                    Keeping content fresh is key, but having only seasonal content will only attract 
                    traffic on those seasons, failing upon launch is a good thing, 
                    don't expect your website to just be a success, it needs work and having a dedicated individual put up to this task is very important.
