 <h3 class="h3">Why affiliate programmes in first place</h3>
           
          <p class="lead">
              Affiliate programmes are a great way to monetize any website or application,
              Website publishers tend to benefit 30%-60% from traffic on qualified leads, 
              while email marketers gain around 85% with just email campaigns,
              various tools are used to measure the output or ROI from such campaigns,
              other technologies such as CTR and Delivery rates are monitored in realtime,
              the campaign manager measures the success through CTR for a relative sales funnel,
              a conversion when a user performs an action,
              websites capture the actions users take, 
              if your website is not like this then you are doing something wrong,
              customers need to be tracked every step of the way or process,
              qualified leads are generally interested on the service already,
              the other waypoint is that the is education taking place,
              each website visitor learns about new products or services,
              the returning visitor is not new anymore, the user will have some understanding,
              clear product introduction of what the service entails,
              this triggers a response action to either sign up or buy,
              the website needs to provide value to the user or solve a particular complex problem,

      <h3 class="h3">Problem </h3>
      
          <p class="lead">
              We introduce a series of problems to every visitor,
              Every problem we present, we highlight its potential to do harm,
              such harm can either be direct or indirect,
              job loss is directly related to credit risks,
              unemployment is also linked to poverty, we look at every aspect of the problem,
              the problem is not just being unemployment but the effects,
              what a person's experience is when having no income, 
              there is certainly no buying power, living conditions start affecting the individual,
              we simply know where the jobs are also having access, being in the position of power,
              we break a deal with the job seeker, not necessarily demanding payment but everything happens in the background,
              this part of the problem is what presents new sets of issues,
              but that part which was the problem, unemployment is settled.

          <h3 class="h3">Solution</h3>
       
          
          <p class="lead">Choosing the right affiliate network is not rocket science,
              The scenario here is to sell, 
              your website either selling or promoting some internal product,
              the affiliate network might be a bridge to leverage the services that you don't know currently have,
              if your business sells cars insurance, your affiliate sells cars insurance this won't benefit your company,
              rather have affiliate network that service cars, or dealership even towing services with monthly premium,
              there should be some relevancy towards the services and platform that these services are being offered on,
              there should be no direct competition, but should allow the publisher to learn about other products, 
              it is recommended that you use affiliate for overly complex services if your company is limited through capital,
              also bring about common services to a single platform, instead of allowing your users to move from website to website,
              this ecosystem is what makes many platforms successful.
