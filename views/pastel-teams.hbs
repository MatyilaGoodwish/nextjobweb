<p class="lead">
   <b> Managing the marketing pages for your company is no easy
task.</b> Everyone is trying to get their message across and each
page has multiple stakeholders that want to give their input. There
are many things that can get in the way of a successful launch, but
getting feedback from your team shouldnâ€™t be one of them. 
</p>

<p class="lead">
    Limiting back-and-forth and enabling your team to give clear and
actionable feedback will allow you to build websites that convert
better, in less time. This is where Pastel comes in!
