                    What to expect after implementing change
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    Change should not be implemented quickly,
                    all change affects user perceptions differently,
                    only a limited users like websites that change often,
                    a simple to use website is the best solution for SEO,
                    users do not like complex websites,
                    traffic will get affected, there is a possibility of loosing your audience,
                    just because your competitor updated their website, 
                    this does not mean you should do the same to your affiliate website,
                    take time planning the change, how users will accept the change as a 
                    way to make the website more simpler or quicker,
                    not something entirely different or looking like a different company,
                    people learn to use websites, other websites already present the same
                    features, what makes your affiliate website unique is content strategies.

                <h3 class="h3">Waiting for the website to load</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                    Slow internet connection makes websites with heavy assets take time to load,
                    by heavy assets, we mean those extremely large pixel images, embedded video content,
                    thousands of uncompressed script files and stylesheets,
                    a slow loading website affects the experience, 
                    when it takes time to navigate to the next page, users often find the closing the tab makes their problem go away,
                    closing the tab is loosing a sale, affiliate websites should focus only on one thing only,
                    introducing the product and capturing users attention.
                </p>
                <h3 class="h3">Modal dialog greeting</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                    When people meet strangers, they greet each other firstly that then names are exchanged,
                    using a modal popup box introduces your service, dialog boxes need to be used well to send the right message,
                    a simple dialog box contains a clear command or call to action(CTA),
                    when you want to make it easier for someone who has a busy life,
                    show them a dialog requesting the user to just request a callback from your company,
                    this saves time, allows your company contact database to grow much quicker,
                    introduce your brand, have a beautiful dialog promoting your product or service popup,
                    there are many benefits to this, example is that some people just need to talk to a real human,
                    others are just the real world responses, such as a user not finding time to go through the content on your website,
                    if you offer a service, get straight to the point your experience and work should sell itself.

                <h3 class="h3">Contact forms on hero section</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                    Do not forget the headline, otherwise the form will remain prestine. Encourage the users that it is important to fill the form,
                    make it a requirement, draw attention towards the form using directional images,
                    there are a ton of stock images you could use for this, repurpose your affiliate strategy towards a powerful landing page,
                    that follows the same strategies of a sales funnel, 
                    your affiliate website should have many CTA's on the website,
                    interesting headlines always makes the reader interested,
                    you do not want to lose your prospects, respect the users privacy do not have too many advertisements also.

                <h3 class="h3">Why confirmation matters</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                    Using simple confirmation dialogs is not professional, 
                    same as using 3rd party libraries such as <a href="https://sweetalert2.github.io/">sweetalert.io</a>, 
                    reconsider this and proceed with caution,
                    a user expects pages do not make your website too design centric, 
                    limit the use of 3rd party JavaScript frameworks,
                    keep things simple its about getting the customer to engage,
                    direct the user to a comfirmation page its as simple as that,
                    another reason for doing that is reducing the number of client side requests,
                    the browser will take more time to load, refrain from using too many client side scripts.
